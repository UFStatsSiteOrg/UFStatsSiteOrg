### Description 
This project is part of a class requirement for Intro to Software Engineering at the University of Florida. Our team was tasked with finding a client who would benenfit from software produced using key software engineering principles in an Agile framework.
Our client was the University of Florida Statistics Club president who requested that we develop a new website for their organization with key features such as an R interpreter for running statistical analyses and an embedded spreadsheet to display internship opportunities for club members.
